            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faqColumn">

                <p class="faqQuestion">Is this real? Will my Member of Congress listen?</p>
                <p class="faqAnswer">Yes and yes. This is a completely serious service for anyone who wants to contact their elected officials. Their staff will pick up the phone and listen to your message, which will include your name and the fact that you are a constituent.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">What am I asking Congress to do?</p>
                <p class="faqAnswer">Remove Donald Trump from office because of his confession of sexual assault and cover ups for other abusers in his White House. He is not above the law, and should be treated in the same way as other powerful men in Congress and elsewhere when their history of abuse was revealed.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">Why shouldn’t I just call Congress myself?</p>
                <p class="faqAnswer">You can! There is nothing wrong with a regular call, but Trump’s confession of sexual assault speaks for itself, and we thought this was more efficient.</p>

            </div>
            
            <div class="faqColumn">

                <p class="faqQuestion">How will they know who's calling?</p>
                <p class="faqAnswer">By default we include your name, city and zip code at the start of the call. After listening to your message, your rep(s) get the option to replay it or to hear your name and location again.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">What if my congressperson doesn't answer the call?</p>
                <p class="faqAnswer">Our robots will wait an hour and then try a different number. Most reps have a least two (some as many as eight) office phone numbers. Our robots will try to call each.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">Does it cost anything?</p>
                <p class="faqAnswer">This page is free to use, but every call costs the creators of this site a small amount. If you want to pitch in to support more projects like this, <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
